# Submission 01

Basic viewer funtionality implemented.

Tested on VS 2015, Windows 10.

Inorder to compile the code, you need to change two #define's in main.hpp:
    1. SCENE_FILE_NAME: the path + name of the scene json file (e.g. "C:/path_to_scene_file/scene.json")
    2. SHADERS_DIR: the directory where the shaders locate without trailing slash (e.g. "C:/path_to_shaders")
